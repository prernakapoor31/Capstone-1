# Data Science Project 

Crime has been prevalent in our society for a very long time.
It continues to be a threat to us and our society and demands serious consideration if we hope to reduce the onset of the repercussions caused by it. Hundreds of crimes are recorded daily by the data officers working alongside the law enforcement authorities throughout the United States.

In this experiment, we deal with data containing the rate of violent crime (crimes per 1,000 population) for California, its regions, counties, cities, and towns. Crime and population data are from the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Uniform Crime Reports.
