# Statistical Analysis of Violent Crime Rates in California

Crime has been prevalent in our society for a very long time.
It continues to be a threat to us and our society and demands serious consideration if we hope to reduce the onset of the repercussions caused by it. Hundreds of crimes are recorded daily by the data officers working alongside the law enforcement authorities throughout the United States.

In this experiment, we deal with data containing the rate of violent crime (crimes per 1,000 population) for California, its regions, counties, cities, and towns. Crime and population data are from the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Uniform Crime Reports.
# First Hypothesis:
1. Does the total violent crime rate differ in every region of California?

Null Hypothesis

Ho= the rate of violent crimes in each region of California is the same.

Alternate Hypothesis

Ha= the rate of violent crimes in at least one region is different from others.

# Second Hypothesis:
2. Does the crime rate change between the year 2009 and 2013?

Null Hypothesis:

Ho= crime rate is different between the year 2009 and 2013.

Alternate Hypothesis:

Ha= crime rate is same between the year 2009 and 2013.
